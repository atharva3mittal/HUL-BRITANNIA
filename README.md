# HUL-BRITANNIA
This project models a hypothetical merger between Britannia Industries and Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL). Built in Excel, it evaluates acquisition premiums, financing structures, and earnings impact for the combined FMCG giant.

The model treats one FMCG major as the acquirer and the other as the target, and tests acquisition premiums of 15%–35% with a financing mix of 20% cash, 50% debt, and 30% acquirer equity. Standalone inputs capture full P&L stacks for each company (sales, COGS, SG&A, D&A, interest, other income, tax) and diluted share counts. On combination, revenues sum to ₹664,416 million, with COGS of ₹403,881 million and SG&A of ₹121,902 million (no explicit revenue or cost synergies assumed). This yields EBITDA of ₹138,633 million and EBIT of ₹125,720 million pre-financing effects.
Financing is split per the “Sources of Funds” grid, with acquisition value scaling by premium (₹1,275,863–₹1,497,753 million). Cash incurs a post-tax opportunity cost of 3.75%; debt cost is set to 0% in the template (i.e., no interest expense modelled), and equity is captured via new share issuance. At a 15% premium, implied cash/debt/equity usage is ~₹255,173/₹637,932/₹382,759 million, with new shares issued of ~148–174 million across the premium range.
Earnings analysis shows combined PBT of ~₹112,961–₹110,742 million as premiums rise (driven primarily by higher foregone interest on larger cash outlays), and taxes of ~₹28,240–₹27,686 million. Resulting net income trends from ~₹84,721 million (15% premium) to ~₹83,057 million (35%). On a per-share basis, the model indicates EPS accretion versus the acquirer’s standalone EPS (₹35.22): post-deal EPS ranges from ₹36.05 (15% premium) to ₹35.34 (35% premium), implying ~+2.36% to +0.35% accretion. A “quick & dirty” rule cross-check confirms accretion because the target’s earnings yield (~1.21% declining to ~1.03% at higher premiums) exceeds the weighted after-tax cost of funds (~0.75%) under the stated assumptions.
